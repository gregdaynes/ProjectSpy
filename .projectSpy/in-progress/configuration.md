Configuration
===

Sometimes we need more than states of Backlog, In Progress and Done. This warrants a way to configure the application to allow for extra columns (maybe Inbox and Blocked). 

This could also lead to things like theming, and customizing buttons / names of things (replacing ProjectSpy in the header with the Project's actual name).

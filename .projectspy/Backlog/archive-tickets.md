Archiving old, completed tickets
================================

When a ticket is completed, it's moved to done. Overtime, we probably don't want to see the ticket any longer.

1. use timestamp filtering - don't show tickets older than a configured period of time.
2. Move the ticket into a folder not tracked by the application.

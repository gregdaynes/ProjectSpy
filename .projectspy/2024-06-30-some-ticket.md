Title of Ticket
===================

This is my super awesome description of the think i need to do.

- [ ] This is a subtask or something
- [ ] think about making this as freeform as possible?
- [ ] - Or do we just use json + editor.js
- [ ] What about date information?
- [ ] - Date created, Date modified from the OS might be good enough.
- [ ] We'll need a status, where does that go? Frontmatter?
- [ ] - what about making the first character of the card the status - emoji checkmark?
- [ ] - scrumoji might work http://scrumoji.org
- [ ] - what about just using 0-10 emojis
- [ ] - a config override that is a list of tuples [icon, column name]. Order dependent
- [ ] multiple projects? folders
